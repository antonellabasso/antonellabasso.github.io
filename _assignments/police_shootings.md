<center><b> Exploratory Questions </b></center> 

- To what extent does one’s race impact their likelihood of being shot/killed by police in the US?
- What other factors might contribute to one’s chances of falling victim to police brutality?
- Is there a potential relationship between a state’s political climate and the level of racial inequality evidenced in police shootings?
- What inferences can we make about the US criminal justice system and the role that race plays in police violence?


<h1> I. Introduction </h1>

Unwarranted deaths at the hands of law enforcement, like those of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, have recently become a more pressing issue in the US. Many such extreme instances of police brutality have become realized as a genuine threat to marginalized communities and given rise to social movements, like “Black Lives Matter”, as a way to combat structural racism and catalyze more drastic police reforms. Though the presence of racial disparities in police violence is not a new issue in the US, evidence like that which we provide in this work is vital to both gauging the true magnitude of the problem and encouraging positive change. Moreover, while the data used for this project is publicly available, it is important to emphasize that a lack of adequate visualizations and representations of such information contributes to the gap in public awareness regarding the extent to which marginalized communities and individuals are harmed by our institutions. To this end, we hope to shed some light on the racial discrepancies evidenced by documented police shootings in recent years, primarily focusing on Black and white racial groups and their varying degrees of susceptibility to police violence across the country.
