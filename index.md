I am currently a Sc.M. student in Biostatistics at Brown University, where I am gaining experience and refining my skills in statistics, data science/analysis, and AI/ML, with a focus on public health applications. As a second year graduate student, I am now eager to explore my passions for social justice and quantitative science in a research endeavor to promote fairness in ML and predictive models via causal-based methods, under the mentorship of [Dr. Alice Paul](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/apaul6).
