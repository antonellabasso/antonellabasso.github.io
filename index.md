I've recently graduated with a Sc.M. in Biostatistics from Brown University, where I've gained ample experience in areas of data science, ML, and statistics with a focus on public health applications. With previous backgrounds in mathematics and philosophy, I am particularly drawn to causal inference and the intersection of fairness and automated decision making, which has been a driving force behind my master's thesis. Specifically, I’ve dedicated my research to developing a causally-motivated approach to fair predictive modeling, under the mentorship of [Dr. Alice Paul](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/apaul6), that appeals to path-specific effects and penalized maximum likelihood estimation within a counterfactual reasoning framework&mdash;the goal behind this work being to foster a more transparent and flexible decision making environment, allowing users to gauge the contextual trade-offs in accuracy and fairness to establish more sound and explainable solutions. Having successfully completed my academic journey, I am now excited to embark on this new chapter in my career, where I can leverage my quantitative skills and unique perspectives to make meaningful contributions in industry as a dedicated professional.
