I am currently a second year Sc.M. student in Biostatistics at Brown University, where I am gaining ample experience in areas of data science and ML, as well as statistics with a focus on public health applications. With previous backgrounds in mathematics and philosophy, I am particularly drawn to the intersection of fairness and automated decision making, which has been a driving force behind my master's thesis. Specifically, Iâ€™ve dedicated my research to developing a causally-motivated approach to fair predictive modeling, under the mentorship of [Dr. Alice Paul](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/apaul6), that appeals to path-specific effects and penalized maximum likelihood estimation within a counterfactual reasoning framework. As the end of my graduate journey draws near, I am eager explore industry opportunities where I may apply my quantitiative skills in impactful ways as a professional.
