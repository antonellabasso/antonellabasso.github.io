**Description:** This course provided a foundation for statistical thinking in clinical and population health research involving longitudinal data. Topics ranged from exploratory analysis, study design considerations, covariance structures, and modeling approaches for longitudinal data, including marginal and mixed effects generalized linear models for both continuous and categorical outcomes. Extensive use of computer programming, particularly in R and STATA, was required to analyze longitudinal data from a range of medical and pharmaceutical applications, as well as public health and the social sciences.
