> Statistical computing is an essential part of analysis as it enables us to pose and answer meaningful questions. Statisticians must not only be able to run existing computer software, but understand how the software functions and how to interact with data in a computational setting.

**Textbook:** Irizarry, R.A. (2019). [*Introduction to Data Science: Data Analysis and Prediction Algorithms with R*](http://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/dsbook/). Chapman and Hall/CRC. ISBN 978-0-429-34183-0.

**Description:** This course taught students to rationalize problems through logic, and in turn, translate that logic into code. With a focus on the application of these skills in statistical settings, the course sought to foster a computational way of thinking through exposure to programming in R&mdash;particularly its primary building blocks and libraries, the development of good coding practices, and the ability to read and evaluate otherâ€™s code through group exercises.
